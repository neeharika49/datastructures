Given pointer to the head node of a linked list, the task is to reverse the linked list. We need to reverse the list by changing the links between nodes.

Examples: 

Input: Head of following linked list 
1->2->3->4->NULL 
Output: Linked list should be changed to, 
4->3->2->1->NULL
CODE:
class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to reverse a linked list.
    struct Node* reverseList(struct Node *head)
    {
        // code here
        // return head of reversed list
        Node*p=NULL;
        Node*c=head;
        Node*n;
        while(c!=NULL)
        {
            n=c->next;
            c->next=p;
            p=c;
            c=n;
        }
        head=p;
        return head;
    }
    
}
